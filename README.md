# Data Structures and Algorithms with Java

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository. This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms, along with solved problems. I will continue to add new data structures, algorithms, and examples over time.

## Contents

### GraphWithAdjList

- Implementation of an unweighted graph using an adjacency list.
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search)

  - Topological Sort
  - Single Source Shortest Path Problem with BFS

### GraphWithMatrix

- Implementation of an unweighted graph using an adjacency matrix.
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  - DFS (Depth-First Search)
  - Topological Sort
  - Single Source Shortest Path Problem with BFS

### WeightedGraphs

- Implementation of a weighted graph.
  - Single Source Shortest Path Problem with Dijkstra's Algorithm

### Heaps

- Implementation of a binary heap data structure.

### Queue

- Implementation of a queue data structure.

### Stack/StackWithArray

- Implementation of a stack data structure using an array.
